    <h2>About Hema</h2>
    <p>I am a senior at Queens College studying computer science and enviornmental studies. 
      I recently just finished my computer science major and now completing my general requirements and my minor courses. 
      Here are a few things I do around campus:
      <ol>
        <li>I am Vice President and co-founder of QC SASA (Queens College South Asian Student Association) and our goal is to spread 
          their culture throughout the campus and create a safe space for everyone.</li>
        <li>Along with that I am on Academic Senate and the Chair of Lobbying/Advising which means if student feels disrespected by a 
          department or feel like their voice isn't being heard, they come to me and I fix that.</li>
        <li>I am a Student Ambassador, so I give tours to prespective or incoming students and tell them why they should come to Queens 
          College</li>
        <li>I am a mentor to a few students who are in my major</li>
        <li>I am on a research team at school called Neanderthal Labs and it's part of the School of Earth and Enviornmental Science, and
          at the end of August I will be going on an expedition to an underwater volcano where I spent the last year researching.</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>What she likes to do on her free time</h2>
    <p>With the small amount of free time I have I like to draw, paint, and embroider. I like to hang around my friends and family, 
      try new food places, do new activitie, and play with my dog as much as I can. I love to hike and travel to new places with my parents.
